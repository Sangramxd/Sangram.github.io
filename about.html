    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), with a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0.</p>
    <p>My interests lie at the intersection of mechanical systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics. I'm currently involved in research projects that span reinforcement learning, SLAM in mining environments, soft robotics, and graph neural networks applied to engineering design.</p>
